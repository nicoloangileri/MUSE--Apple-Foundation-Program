# MUSE--Apple-Foundation-Program
iOS application developed at the Apple Foundation Program. It leverages Sentiment Analysis and a custom JSON database to match books with music tracks based on textual vibes.

#  Muse
*An iOS application developed during the Apple Foundation Program.*

## Overview
**Muse** is a data-driven iOS application that bridges the gap between literature and music. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and Sentiment Analysis, the app analyzes the thematic and emotional "vibe" of a book and recommends a curated list of songs that perfectly match its mood.

## Technical Features
* **Sentiment Analysis (NLP):** Utilizes the VADER model methodology to process book descriptions, compute raw emotional metrics, and generate normalized sentiment scores.
* **Complex Data Handling:** Parses, decodes, and manages a custom-built JSON database containing deep book metadata, sentiment parameters, and track fallbacks.
* **Tech Stack:** Swift / SwiftUI.

##  Why this project stands out
Beyond standard UI/UX development, this project demonstrates a strong foundation in **handling structured data**, applying **algorithmic logic** for data matching, and integrating **quantitative text-analysis metrics** into a functional mobile environment. 

*Developed by Nicolò Angileri & Team - Apple Foundation Program 2026*
